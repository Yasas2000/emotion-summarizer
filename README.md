# Emotion-Aware Text Summarizer

An open-source NLP project that performs emotion-aware summarization using transformer-based models. The system detects fine-grained emotions in text using a RoBERTa-based classifier and generates summaries conditioned on those emotions using an emotion-tagged BART model.
